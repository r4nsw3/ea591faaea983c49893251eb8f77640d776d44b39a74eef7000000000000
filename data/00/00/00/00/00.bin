  |   Saints Row: The Third - The Full Package gives you control of the     |
  |   Saints at the height of their power, and you live the life to show    |
  |   for it.                                                               |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Put the wildest chapter of the Saints Row saga in the palms of your   |
  |   hands for the first time on Switch. You bring the fight to            |
  |   Steelport, a sordid city of sin drowning in sex, drugs, and (a lot    |
  |   of) guns. This is your City. These are your rules.                    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Years after taking Stilwater for their own, the Third Street Saints   |
  |   have evolved from street gang to household brand name, with Saints    |
  |   sneakers, Saints energy drinks and Johnny Gat bobblehead dolls all    |
  |   available at a store near you. The Saints are kings of Stilwater,     |
  |   but their celebrity status has not gone unnoticed. The Syndicate, a   |
  |   legendary criminal fraternity with pawns in play all over the         |
  |   globe, has turned its eye on the Saints and demands tribute.          |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Refusing to kneel to the Syndicate, you take the fight to             |
  |   Steelport, a once-proud metropolis reduced to a struggling city of    |
  |   sin under Syndicate control. Take a tank skydiving, call in a         |
  |   satellite-targeted airstrike on a Mexican wrestling gang, and         |
  |   defend yourself against a highly-trained military force using only    |
  |   a sex toy in the most outlandish gameplay scenarios ever seen.        |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Saints Row: The Third - The Full Package is the definitive release    |
  |   of one of gaming's most beloved entries, playable on a Nintendo       |
  |   system for the first time ever with new features for Nintendo         |
  |   Switch.                                                               |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * City of Sin - Disrupt and dismantle the Syndicate stranglehold on   |
  |     weapons, cybercrime, and sex trades. Discover the secrets of        |
  |     Steelport, where there is action on every street corner, for        |
  |     better or, more likely, worse                                       |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Weapons of Crass Destruction - It's one thing to defeat your        |
  |     enemies. It's another to humiliate them. Hover jets, human          |
  |     cannonball cars and sex-toy warfare are all part of the fun         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Crazy Character Customization - Create the most outlandish          |
  |     characters every seen, from washed-up celebrities to naked ninja    |
  |     pirates. Inside every sinner, there is a Saint. Who will you        |
  |     become                                                              |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Portable Over The Top Co-op - Fly solo, or play online with a       |
  |     homie and for the first time - two players can play side to side    |
  |     via online or local multiplayer. Give naked skydiving a try,        |
  |     landing in your partner's flaming pickup as you make a suicide      |
  |     run toward a heavily armed Syndicate brothel. Steelport is more     |
  |     fun with a friend                                                   |
  |                                                                         |

  |     30 DLC items. All previously released content is included on the    |

  |   * Two DLC packs - the Bloodsucker Pack and the Unlockable Pack,       |
  |     have been omitted for game balance and improvement based on         |
  |     feedback                                                            |
